# Stultus Studios
An experimental multimedia company

Currently, for software & hardware we are working on:
* Mesh, an react and next.js blog engine with custom templating and MDX extensions for fully custom article entries.
* An untitled stream controller project based around Flask, TouchDesigner, and the Twitch API.
